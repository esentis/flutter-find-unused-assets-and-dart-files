## Introduction

This extension allows you to find unused assets, Dart files & dependencies in your project. Simply open the command palette (<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>) and run the `Flutter: Find Unused Dart Files & Assets` command. The output will be displayed in the Output panel of Visual Studio Code.

## Features

- Detects unused asset files in the `assets/` directory.
- Detects unused dependencies listed in the `pubspec.yaml `file.
- Detects unused Dart files in the `lib/` directory.

## Usage

- Open your project in Visual Studio Code.
- Open the command palette (<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>).
- Type `Flutter: Find Unused Dart Files & Assets` and select the corresponding command from the list.
- The results will be displayed in the Output panel.

## Tips

If you have multiple projects open in Visual Studio Code, make sure to switch to the correct one before running the command.
The results may take a few seconds to appear, so be patient.

We hope this extension helps you in cleaning up your projects and improving the performance. Enjoy!
